# Sequence Diff Annotations

Annotates mutations in closely related proteins. A straightforward application
is the comparison of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV2 proteins.

There is a target sequence for which we want to define the annotations and a
reference sequence for comparison. Given an alignment generated by a pairwise
Needleman-Wunsch algorithm, non-conserved amino acids are annotated.
As of now, insertions and deletions are ignored.

To run the code snippet below, you need the root directory of the git
repository in your PYTHONPATH. On Linux/Mac execute the following:

```
export PYTHONPATH=<path_to_covid_repo>:$PYTHONPATH
```

I'm confident that Windows users will also figure it out...


```
import seq_diff_annotations

scov_2_poly_ac = 'P0DTD1'
scov_poly_ac = 'P0C6X7'

# due to the inefficient alignment implementation, this may take a while
annotation = seq_diff_annotations.get_annotation(scov_2_poly_ac, scov_poly_ac)

print("url with annotations:", annotation.post())
```

The code pushes the annotations using a post request and produces 
the following example ouput:
```
url with annotations: https://beta.swissmodel.expasy.org/repository/covid_annotation_project/4QxbPW
```
The URL should remain valid for a while, so feel free to directly inspect the
results.
