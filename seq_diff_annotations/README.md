# Sequence Diff Annotations

Annotates mutations in closely related proteins. A straightforward application
is the comparison of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV2 proteins.

There is a target sequence for which we want to define the annotations and a
reference sequence for comparison. Given an alignment generated by a pairwise
Needleman-Wunsch algorithm, non-conserved amino acids are annotated.
As of now, insertions and deletions are ignored.

The example code snippet has OpenStructure (https://openstructure.org/) 
as dependency but I'm thinking of removing it to have a minimal example.

Another prerequisite is that you have the root directory of the github 
repository in your PYTHONPATH. On Linux/Mac execute the following:

```
export PYTHONPATH=<path_to_covid_repo>:$PYTHONPATH
```

Windows users will already have a super hard time to get OpenStructure 
up and running. So they might have to wait until I removed that 
dependency.


```
import seq_diff_annotations

scov_2_spike_ac = 'P0DTC2' 
scov_spike_ac = 'P59594'

annotation = seq_diff_annotations.get_annotation(scov_2_spike_ac, scov_spike_ac)

print("url with annotations:", annotation.post())
```
